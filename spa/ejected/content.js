    "Thanks to its convenient location, only a couple hundred meters from Nagoya Station, Cafe Cooktown is a popular place for a morning sandwich. Despite the chance of having to wait outside before entering the packed cafe, it is still worth enjoying your Morning Service here. The line outside might make it easier to find the cafe as the entrance can be easily overlooked.",

    "This cafe is especially a good deal if you feel like having a bigger breakfast to start your day. Once again, enjoy a free breakfast with your coffee, tea, juice, or soft drink. You will be served four sandwiches filled generously with egg and cucumber and seasoned with ketchup.",

    "This will guarantee a good start to your day!"

In addition to their delicious sweets, they also offer a variety of Japanese dishes such as Sushi, Udon, Soba, and Donburi. Hanagoyomi also offers the possibility to enjoy your breakfast, lunch, or dinner outside on their roofed terrace. Pets are also welcome!",

    "Compared to most of the cafes listed here, the Morning Service at Hanagoyomi consists of decidedly traditional Japanese breakfast items. Every morning you receive a complimentary salad and Chawanmushi (steamed egg) with your favorite drink. Additionally, you get to choose between toast, Onigiri (rice ball), and a seasonal item. From April on you can opt for a cold Ochazuke (rice with tea poured over). In October the Ochazuke is replaced with Okayu (rice porridge)."

    "Locals like to come every day for their flat rate drip coffee and Morning set. The lucky ones living in Nagoya can enjoy this every morning for a monthly subscription of only 4000 yen. It makes you want to stay in Nagoya even longer. And why not? There are plenty of things to do and discover!",

    "Even if you stay in Nagoya for a short while, you can still try their Morning Service any day. Enjoy your coffee, tea, or juice with buttered toast, boiled egg, and salad. At an additional price, you can also opt for an Ogura toast, ham egg toast, or one of their specialty toast with fruits and whipped cream."

    "Kako Bucyo Coffee, located around 15 minutes away from JR Nagoya Station on foot, is a popular local coffee shop. The specialty of this store that is always bustling with customers despite its distance from the station, is its house-brewed coffee and matching homemade bread! During breakfast and lunch time, there is also a great offer of coffee and food combos that lets you enjoy your meal with a cup of coffee in your hand for good prices. Another point of recommendation is that the generously poured coffee comes with one free refill!",

    "There is a great offer of combo menus in the morning from the opening until 10:30 and during lunch from 11:00 to 14:30. Especially in the morning, there is a great service that if you order a cup of coffee it comes with a homemade piece of bread or a toast.",

    "The most popular item on the store's menu is the Kako specialty ogura toast （350 yen）. Ogura toast is a golden-toasted slice of bread topped with anko （red bean paste） and is a specialty of Nagoya, but the unique point of this store's one is the whipped cream on top the anko."
