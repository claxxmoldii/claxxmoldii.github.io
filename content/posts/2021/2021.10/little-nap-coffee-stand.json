    "Just across from Yoyogi Park in Shibuya, youâ€™ll find Little Nap Coffee Stand, a tiny coffee shop with a few extra seats outside. It has a laid-back atmosphere and the friendly owner, Daisuke Hamada, will be more than happy to engage in conversation with visitors.",

     "The high-quality beans are roasted on-site, and the <a href='/'>menu</a> includes single-origin drip coffee along with the typical espresso-based drinks, which are prepared on a Synesso machine."
