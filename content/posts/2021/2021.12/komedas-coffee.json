    "If you are looking for a cozy place for breakfast or lunch while you are in Nagoya or maybe even to rest your feet and have some delicious coffee in the afternoon after a long day of sightseeing you might want to check out Komeda’s Coffee.",

    "This coffee house embodies everything you imagine a Japanese coffee house to be. Comfortable plush red chairs and a nice wooden interior are just the two most obvious features this cafe uses to let their customers relax and feel like they are at home in their own living room.",

    "The first branch of Komeda’s Coffee was opened in 1968 in Nagoya. The strategy to open a coffee house where people would feel at home and serving excellent coffee and freshly made bread succeeded and in no time Komedas spread through branches and franchises all over the country.",

    "It shaped the Japanese coffee culture as we know it today and it might just be the best Japanese coffee shop or at least serving the best coffee in Nagoya."
