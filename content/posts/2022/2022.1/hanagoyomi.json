    "This Japanese sweets cafe is stylish on the inside with its modern wooden interior. In addition to their delicious sweets, they also offer a variety of Japanese dishes such as Sushi, Udon, Soba, and Donburi. Hanagoyomi also offers the possibility to enjoy your breakfast, lunch, or dinner outside on their roofed terrace. Pets are also welcome!",

    "Compared to most of the cafes listed here, the Morning Service at Hanagoyomi consists of decidedly traditional Japanese breakfast items. Every morning you receive a complimentary salad and Chawanmushi (steamed egg) with your favorite drink. Additionally, you get to choose between toast, Onigiri (rice ball), and a seasonal item. From April on you can opt for a cold Ochazuke (rice with tea poured over). In October the Ochazuke is replaced with Okayu (rice porridge)."
