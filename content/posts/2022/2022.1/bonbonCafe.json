    "Bon Bon Cafe is one of the oldest cafes in the city. Its history goes back to 1949. When dropping by this cafe, you can really feel that it has been around for a while. If you are eager to visit a traditional Nagoya-style cafe Bon Bon is the place to check out.",

    "The cafe offers a standard Morning Service consisting of toast and a boiled egg. You are also given the option to add a jam, yogurt, or mini salad on the side for an additional 100 yen. But really, people come here for the nostalgic atmosphere rather than the free breakfast. Especially regulars enjoy staying here for a long time in the morning."
