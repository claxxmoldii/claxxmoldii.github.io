    "Thanks to its convenient location, only a couple hundred meters from Nagoya Station, Cafe Cooktown is a popular place for a morning sandwich. Despite the chance of having to wait outside before entering the packed cafe, it is still worth enjoying your Morning Service here. The line outside might make it easier to find the cafe as the entrance can be easily overlooked.",

    "This cafe is especially a good deal if you feel like having a bigger breakfast to start your day. Once again, enjoy a free breakfast with your coffee, tea, juice, or soft drink. You will be served four sandwiches filled generously with egg and cucumber and seasoned with ketchup.",

    "This will guarantee a good start to your day!"
