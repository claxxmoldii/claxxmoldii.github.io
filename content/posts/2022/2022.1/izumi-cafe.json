    "Izumi Cafe opened only recently, in 2019, and quickly became a popular spot for getting a Morning Service. It is located inside a 50-year-old building and has an incredibly stylish and modern interior. However, this is not the only reason Izumi-Cafe is popular.",

    "Locals like to come every day for their flat rate drip coffee and Morning set. The lucky ones living in Nagoya can enjoy this every morning for a monthly subscription of only 4000 yen. It makes you want to stay in Nagoya even longer. And why not? There are plenty of things to do and discover!",

    "Even if you stay in Nagoya for a short while, you can still try their Morning Service any day. Enjoy your coffee, tea, or juice with buttered toast, boiled egg, and salad. At an additional price, you can also opt for an Ogura toast, ham egg toast, or one of their specialty toast with fruits and whipped cream."
