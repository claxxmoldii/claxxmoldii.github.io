    <article class=""><p>Kako Bucyo Coffee, located around 15 minutes away from JR Nagoya Station on foot, is a popular local coffee shop. The specialty of this store that is always bustling with customers despite its distance from the station, is its house-brewed coffee and matching homemade bread! During breakfast and lunch time, there is also a great offer of coffee and food combos that lets you enjoy your meal with a cup of coffee in your hand for good prices. Another point of recommendation is that the generously poured coffee comes with one free refill!</p><p>There is a great offer of combo menus in the morning from the opening until 10:30 and during lunch from 11:00 to 14:30. Especially in the morning, there is a great service that if you order a cup of coffee it comes with a homemade piece of bread or a toast.</p><p>The most popular item on the store's menu is the Kako specialty ogura toast （350 yen）. Ogura toast is a golden-toasted slice of bread topped with anko （red bean paste） and is a specialty of Nagoya, but the unique point of this store's one is the whipped cream on top the anko.</p></article>
